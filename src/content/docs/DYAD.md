# Dyads

This repo supports running a paired **actor** + **critic** "dyad" in Docker. The critic runs a closed loop that:

- starts (or recovers) an interactive Codex session for the critic and the actor inside `tmux`
- sends prompts via `tmux send-keys`
- waits for a delimited work report between `<<WORK_REPORT_BEGIN>>` and `<<WORK_REPORT_END>>` (and has a tolerant fallback for Codex-native output)
- persists artifacts under `~/.si/dyad/<dyad>/reports/` (host-backed SI state)


## Requirements

- Docker available on the host
- `tmux` installed in both containers (included in `aureuma/si:local`)
- A logged-in `si login` profile for real Codex runs (or use the offline fake Codex flow below)
  - If Codex launches the "Welcome to Codex" sign-in screen, the dyad loop will halt and log an auth-required message.
    Use `si dyad peek <dyad>` to complete login inside the running `tmux` session, then restart the dyad loop.
- If Docker is root-only on your host, run `si dyad ...` as root and set `SI_HOST_UID`/`SI_HOST_GID` so artifacts are owned by your user.
- The `si` CLI is installed inside dyad containers (same image as Codex containers), so you can run `si vault ...` or other `si` subcommands via `si dyad exec`.

## Loop Control Files

Dyad loops are controlled via files under `~/.si/dyad/<dyad>/`:

- `~/.si/dyad/<dyad>/control.pause`: pause the loop (polls every `DYAD_LOOP_PAUSE_POLL_SECONDS`, default 5s)
- `~/.si/dyad/<dyad>/control.stop`: stop the loop cleanly

If the last persisted critic report contains `Continue Loop: no`, the dyad loop will also remain stopped across restarts/recreates.

## Spawn + Inspect

Spawn a dyad:

```bash
si dyad spawn <name> [role]
```

Autopilot (explicit prompt required):

```bash
si dyad spawn <name> [role] --autopilot --prompt "Investigate failing CI release job"
```

Optional explicit seed prompt:

```bash
si dyad spawn <name> [role] --autopilot --prompt "Investigate failing CI release job"
```

Check status:

```bash
si dyad status <name>
si dyad logs --member critic <name> --tail 200
si dyad logs --member actor <name> --tail 200
```

Machine-readable output:

```bash
si dyad list --json
si dyad status --json <name>
si dyad logs --json --member critic <name> --tail 200
```

## Peek Into Running Sessions (tmux)

To "peek" into the running interactive Codex sessions (even mid-turn):

```bash
si dyad peek <name>
```

Note: host `tmux` sessions are per-user. If you run `si dyad peek` under `sudo`, you'll need to attach/list those sessions as the same user.

Flags:

- `--member actor|critic|both` (default `both`)
- `--detached` to create the host `tmux` session without attaching
- `--session <name>` to override the host peek session name

Under the hood, dyads use tmux session names:

- actor (inside actor container): `si-dyad-<dyad>-actor`
- critic (inside critic container): `si-dyad-<dyad>-critic`

You can also attach manually:

```bash
docker exec -it si-actor-<dyad> tmux attach -t si-dyad-<dyad>-actor
docker exec -it si-critic-<dyad> tmux attach -t si-dyad-<dyad>-critic
```

## Enforcement: Interactive Only + Strict Parsing

The critic loop is designed to drive **interactive** Codex sessions in `tmux` (not `codex exec`).

By default, it uses **tolerant** work-report parsing to work with real Codex output (which can omit explicit markers even when the content is correct). You can force strict parsing:

- `DYAD_LOOP_STRICT_REPORT=1`
- reports must be delimited by the markers above
- actor reports must include the expected section headers (`Summary/Changes/Validation/Open Questions/Next Step for Critic`)
- critic output is treated as a free-form message to the actor (must be non-empty and not Codex UI chrome)
- if Codex returns to a ready prompt without a delimited report, the turn fails fast and retries

The loop is designed to be critic-initiated/critic-driven:

- the actor only receives the critic's generated message (verbatim)
- the critic only receives the actor's work report (no injected template per turn)

## tmux Titles

Dyad tmux windows/panes are labeled with emojis:

- `🪢 <dyad> 🛩️ actor`
- `🪢 <dyad> 🧠 critic`

To override the interactive command used to start Codex (mainly for offline testing), set `DYAD_CODEX_START_CMD`. It rejects `codex exec` to keep dyads interactive-only.

## Tuning

Useful environment variables (set on the host before `si dyad spawn`, or passed into the critic container):

- `DYAD_LOOP_TURN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: per-turn timeout (default `900`)
- `DYAD_LOOP_RETRY_MAX`: retries per actor/critic turn (default `3`)
- `DYAD_LOOP_TMUX_CAPTURE`: `main` or `alt` (default `main`)
- `DYAD_LOOP_TMUX_CAPTURE_LINES`: capture last N lines from tmux (default `8000`)
- `DYAD_LOOP_PROMPT_LINES`: prompt readiness scan depth (default `3`)

## Offline Smoke Tests (No Codex Auth)

If you want to validate tmux + parsing + turn-taking without Codex auth, you can run the dyad loop against `tools/dyad/fake-codex.sh`.

Example:

```bash
export DYAD_CODEX_START_CMD='cd /workspace && exec /workspace/tools/dyad/fake-codex.sh'
export SI_HOST_UID=1000
export SI_HOST_GID=1000
export DYAD_LOOP_ENABLED=1
export DYAD_LOOP_MAX_TURNS=1
export DYAD_LOOP_STRICT_REPORT=1

# Optional: make turns "long" so you can peek mid-run.
export FAKE_CODEX_DELAY_SECONDS=10
export FAKE_CODEX_LONG_LINES=12000

si dyad spawn dyad-offline-test --skip-auth
si dyad peek dyad-offline-test
```
